 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}'
 *
 * A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
 * pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
 * 
 * Return a deep copy of the list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * {"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
 * Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer
 * points to itself.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned
 * list.
